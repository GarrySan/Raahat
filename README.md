# Raahat
Repository for Microsoft CodeFunDo Hackathon.

## Aim: 
Raahat, the real-time dynamic app, aims to optimize rescue operations. We would be using Google Maps API and have a map based interface. 
Affected people are able to send **distress signals**. These distress signals appear as red dots on the map. The app computes the degree of this distress signal based on the information provided along with the distress signal. 

The color intensity and the radius of the red dots increases with this degree of distress signal. This degree of distress is an important factor in computing the most optimal path for saving lives in a rescue operation. 
We provide this **computed optimal path** and **real time data visualizations** to the rescue teams. They can then make decisions based on these data solutions in order to maximise their rescue efforts. 

There would be a third aspect to the app. This would be for the people unaffected in natural disaster (from the surrounding areas). These people would appear on the map as green dots and they would be able to see the affected people on the map as red dots. These people can offer to **provide shelter in their residences** to the affected people and also sign up to volunteer in the rescue missions through the app. 

## Additional features:
1. We also plan to improve this app by adding a **payment gateway to accept donations** for the cause in a more organized way. This could be done by listing ongoing reconstruction and rebalitation projects in the disaster struck area and giving donors a choice among them.

2. Finally we aggregate data coming from trusted news sources, government bodies, NGOs and the data generated by our distress signals. We then **build data visualizations** using this data which can be used to **generate a news feed** in the app. The news feed would help us to get more people interested in donating for the rebuilding efforts and improve the response rate and outreach during the calamity.
